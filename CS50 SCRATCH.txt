HOW TO REPRESENT NUMBERS
We represent numbers using Unary or Binary(0&1)
and each 0s and 1s represent (1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128)i.e ^2

8bits(0-255)

HOW TO REPRESENT LETTERS
WE use 7 or 8 bits to represent letters of an alphabet therefore the letter (A has 0&1 65 times 10000010)
ASCII

Unicode is used to present all human languages digitally it uses 32bits
(U+1F468)=> this is used to represent emoji's

ALGORITHM
This is a step by step instruction for solving problems

Large Language Model(LLM)
this is an implementation in software of code that takes in input lots of languages and infers from the patterns of english words or any human language what a typical human might actually say when asked a question

SCRATCH
Scratch is a visual programming language that allows students to create their own interactive stories, games and animations.

in scratch the purple blocks are called functions and the text in the white ovals are called parameters or arguments i.e they customize the default behavior of a function

the return valuen is a value that can be handed back to you from a function so you can do something with it

abstraction means simplify
