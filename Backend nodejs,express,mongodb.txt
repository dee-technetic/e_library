note IPv4 addresses are 32bit and 4.3 billion ip addresses can be generated but the range of numbers musnt exceed 255 (192.168.1.1)

IPv6:This was developed to address the exhausion of IPv4 addresses it uses 128 bit addresses and they are separated by columns and they provide a larger space

types of ip addresses
public(communication over internet) vs Private(local network)
Static(remains constant overtime) vs Dynamic(assigned by ISPs using DHCP=> dynamic host configuration protocol)

DNS(domain name system)Server
it translates human readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network

Authorotative DNS Servers(read about it)

DNS RESOLUTION PROCESS(Read about)

Protocols
HTTP/HTTPS(uses SSL/TSL)
FTP(used for transfer of filre between a client and server it is commonly used for website management)
